so I figured out what was going wrong with deploying and got really happy
then i realized we don't have a RIO and I can't do anything with the dashboard without a robot
nik stopped listening to me complain why i don't have a rio and now i'm really sad
i need a hero
now i'm just awkwardly typing on the computer because i don't want to join the unsafe
	conversation that's happening to my left
maybe i should just keep typing
Tanner just asked me what i'm doing and i can't answer
what's wrong
how do i stop typing
xander isn't reading this and i really want him to but i can only communicate through this text file
i need help
xander still isn't reading this
the safety captain is hitting people with an orange rubber stick
what do i do
remember to be safe
tanner you should tell xander to read my text file
xander read my file and i'm happier now
but now he said he won't read it anymore
jon came over and wants to read my file
that's pretty interesting
the music is too loud for my liking
xander is awkwardly singing into my face
me too xander
xander is being rude
this is the twenty sixth line, jon

thad is playing with scissors
xander requested me to document the two year anniversary of 2/27
nina continues to hit people with sticks
thad's hat is off
this is a dangerous situation
i don't know, jon
no
scissors are never safe
luke fensertmicher
xander evart esselink
chad has been removed
it's contributing to my insanity you should probably stop me
actually maybe
i think xander became possessed
maybe i am too
xander is dancing a lot now
